- Live Site URL: (https://vinit2587.github.io/stats-card-component/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project helped me learn the grid and flexbox properties of CSS and apply the overlay effect to an image to change its overall colour. After completing this project I have become more confident about my HTML and CSS skills but there's still a lot to learn along the way.

### Continued development

The topics that I would want to focus on in the next projects would be the layout and the alignment of a card component and matching the product to the design as accurately as possible.
